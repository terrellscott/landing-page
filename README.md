# Landing Page Project

This project shows that I am able to manipulate the DOM using JS.

## Languages Used

-HTML
-CSS
-JAVASCRIPT

## Tasks completed

-The createNav() dunction appends a unordered list that creates a navigation bar. Also, it adds an onHover effect using the mouseover and mouseout eventListeners.
-the activeSection() function adds an active class to the section in the viewport, as well as highlights the active link in the nav bar. It also removes the class upon leaving the viewport. 
-Added an on click eventListener to the nav links that begins a scrollIntoView function with the smooth behavior.
-Finally, centered the nav bar to improve the look of the page when viewed on mobile devices.
